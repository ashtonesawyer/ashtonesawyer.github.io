        My name is Ashton Sawyer (he/him) and I am a computer science
        undergraduate student. Right now I don't know what areas in particular I
        want to work in. As such, I'm trying to dip my hand into a little bit of
        everything, whether databases, web development, security, software
        development, or anything in between. I think the best way to find what
        you are passionate about is to try everything that comes your way.
        <br />
        <br />
        I first started coding because I wanted to be able to make my own video
        games, and while this particular dream remains unfulfilled, I want to
        make things, in whatever form. I've always wanted to try woodworking and
        blacksmithing, and I've been producing (albeit mediocre) music for
        around 5 years now. Keeping active is also important to me. I enjoy
        boxing, biking, and weight-lifting, and I have a two-year-old pup who
        gets me outside even when it's raining and I don't want to.
