          <h2>Project Scheduler</h2>
          <p>
            This project aims to take information about any project you might be
            working on and auto-schedule times in Google Calendar to work on it.
            It asks how long you expect the project to complete, what times/days
            you want to work on it, how long you want to work on it in one
            sitting, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a simple GUI written with Tkinter in order to gather the
            information needed. This part of the project is still in progress
            but is currently functional. The main functionality that needs to be
            added is connecting the underlying logic with the GUI so that errors
            can be communicated with the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also one known error with the scheduler itself. Because of
            the way that appointments are loaded into the program to calculate
            chunks of free time, if there are overlapping appointments already
            in the calendar, it can accidentally create a double booking.

              This is a fitness-based chatbot that has 4 main intents. All of
              the exercise information was retrieved from Exercise by
              API-Ninjas. You can test the program in the widget to the left. To
              get started, try typing in “help”
            </p>
            <h3>Intents</h3>
            <p>
              <span class="intent">Create a Workout</span> creates a 3-phase
              workout (warmup, workout, cooldown) based on the muscles that the
              user wants to target, or they could choose to do a stretching or
              cardio-based workout. Because the exercises are chosen randomly
              from a list, there can be repeated exercises listed. More
              importantly, there is a bug where the bot has a problem with
              outputting the workout. I know that the code itself works from
              testing outside of the Dialogflow framework, and I’m not entirely
              sure why it doesn’t work within the app.
              <br />
              <span class="intent">Workout Plan Advice</span> gives basic plan
              advice depending on the user’s workout frequency, goals, and how
              skilled they are.
              <br />
              <span class="intent">Muscle Targeting</span> takes the name of a
              muscle and gives a list of 10 exercises that target that muscle
              <br />
              The <span class="intent">How to</span> intent takes the name of an
              exercise and gives a description of how to do that exercise.
              <br />
              All of the intents could use more example phrases, and the how to
              intent specifically needs more examples of exercise names to match
              with

          <h2>Chocoholics Anonymous</h2>
          <p>
            This was a group project. The goal was to create a piece of software
            to manage the providers and members in a doctor-like organization
            called Chocoholics Anonymous. The end goal was to auto-generate
            financial reports for all of the people in the organization. My job
            was to create the provider database. We didn’t have the resources to
            create an actual database, so all of the providers were managed in a
            JSON file that was saved upon closing and uploaded on opening the
            program.
            <br />
            Unfortunately, this project is held in a private repository managed
            by a different group member, so I cannot link to it here.
