# Personal Website

This is a personal website that has information about my schooling, work experience, and different projects that I've worked on.

## How to Run

I did all of my testing with the Live Server extention for VS Code. More information about the extention can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## Deployment

The site was deployed using GitHub Pages. It can be found at [ashtonesawyer.github.io](https://ashtonesawyer.github.io/).
