        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Foster Home</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work in a local foster home as a skills trainer. I work
          with a non-verbal young adult with down syndrome of a more educational
          basis, working on writing, counting, and learning basic signs to help
          with communication. The other person I work with is a autistic
          teenager, and we primarily focus on social-emotional skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Empowerment Services</h3>
        <p>
          Before my current job, I worked at Empowerment Services, LLC, a day
          program for disabled adults, where I taught general life and work
          readiness skills.
